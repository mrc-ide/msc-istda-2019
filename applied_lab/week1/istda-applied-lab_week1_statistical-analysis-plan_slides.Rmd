## Applied statistical analysis {.build}

<div>
* Statistics is the science of:
  * collecting, summarizing, presenting, and interpreting data,
  * estimating the magnitude of associations,
  * testing hypotheses.
</div>
<div>
* Developing, conducting, and communicating  statistics involves each of these components.
</div>
<div>
* Both written and oral communication are important. 
  * Written: journal articles, reports, _mini-project assessments_, _MSc theses_.
  * Oral: Meetings, lectures and seminars, conferences, policy presentations.
</div>
<div>
* Communication of statistical findings almonst _never_ involves computer code or screen output from statistical programs.
</div>
<div>
* The exact steps and processes of statistical analysis (R commands run, assumptions checked, etc.) 
   are usually not the focus reporting on an analysis.
</div>
<div>
* But it is important that the reporting
   of results communicates that statistical steps have been done properly.
  * This will also be the standard for assessment in this course.
</div>

## Applied Statistics Lab {.columns-2}

* Practice _doing_ statistics:
  * Data preparation and exploratory analysis.
  * Developing an analysis plan.
  * Conducting analysis and interpreting results.
  * Presenting findings.

* Randomly allocated into groups of 4-5 students each (6 total).

* Three group projects analysing a dataset to address a research question. 
  * Continuous outcomes and linear regression
  * Binary data and logistic regression, and
  * Longitudinal data and survival analysis.

* Culminating in 10 minute group presentation of findings (weeks 4, 7, 10).

## Steps in a statistical analysis

1. Identify the research question and hypothesis
1. Define target population
1. Select the dataset and define inclusion/exclusion criteria.
1. Identify variables to be used in main analysis (outcome, main exposure, stratifying variables)
1. Define key shell tables

2. Conduct exploratory data analysis: understand your dataset.
3. Conduct inferential statistics: answer your research quesiton
4. Check assumptions and sensitivity analysis: are the findings robust
5. Interpret the results: state the conclusion to the research question
   * Should be as close to a 'yes'/'no' answer to your hypothesis as possible.
6. Contextualize the findings: how do the findings compare to existing evidence.
7. Implications for policy and practice,


## Two types of statistics

**Descriptive statistics: _Exploratory analysis_**

  * Describe and summarise key features of the dataset
  * _Understanding the characteristics of a particular sample._
  
<br>
<br> 

**Inferential statistics: _Hypothesis driven_**

  * Use data from a _sample_ to draw conclusions about the _population_.
  * Generalizable scientific conclusions that add to general body of knowledge.

## Reading a paper 

* Scientific papers in medicine, epidemiology, and public health follow a formulaic format that map to the steps of a statistical analysis.

* Introduction:
 
  * What is the research question?
  * Why is it important?
  * What is the target population
  
* Methods 
  * Define the dataset
  * Inclusion and exclusion criteria
  * Statistical methods and assumptions

## Reading a paper 

* Results

  * 'Table 1': descriptive statistics
  * Statistical inference results: answers to the research questions.
  
* Conclusions
  
  * Answer primary research question
  * Contextualize findings, compare with other literature
  * Implications for policy, practice, future research

## Exercise 1: Reading a paper---_Liu et al._

* _Systematically_ Read the paper by Liu and colleagues on ambient air pollution and daily mortality.
  * On Blackboard supplementary appendix and accompanying commentary are also provided for interest.
  
* Identify the key parts of the statistical analysis plan communicated in each section.
  
  1. What is the research question and main hypothesis?
  2. What is the target population?
  3. What is the data set? Is it generalizable to the target population? Are there any inclusion/exclusion criteria that limit the generalizability of the findings?
  4. What are the statistical methods and key assumptions?
  5. Identify where and how descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis are reported.
  6. Identify where and how inferential statistical analysis is reported.
  7. What is the answer to the research question enumerated in question 1? Does the evidence of the analysis **support the hypothesis**?
  8. How do the findings compared to other evidence and what is the added value of this study?
  9. What are the consequence fo the interpretation for public health and policy?

## Exercise 2: CDC Hypertension Case Study

* Read the Hypertension Case Study on pages 16-21.

* In your group address and record the following components of the analysis plan:
  
  1. Research question(s) and/or hypotheses.
  2. Dataset(s) to be used.
  3. Inclusion/exclusion criteria.
  4. Variables to be used in the main analysis (List 3-4 outcome and exposure variables).
  5. Statistical methods and software to be used.
