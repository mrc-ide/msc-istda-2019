Today's session will cover:

* Tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)
* Dplyr

and is based on Chapter 9 from R for data science.

***

What do you remember from last week?

## What is tidyverse?

A group of packages for data science:

* __ggplot2__ - plotting
* __dplyr__ - data manipulation
* __tidyr__ - creating tidy data
* readr - reading data
* purr - functional programming
* tibble - modern data frame
* stringr - strings
* forcats - factors

***
We are going to focus on dplyr today.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```
***
## Functionality of dplyr
* filter() picks cases based on their values.
* mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
* select() picks variables based on their names.
* arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
* summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.


***
We are going to use the peru lung data set for this example
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data_peru <- read.csv("../data/perulung_ems.csv")
```


***
## Filtering
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Filter data on sex == 1
filtered_data <- filter(data_peru, sex==1)
head(filtered_data)

```

***
## Using pipes
This is from the _magrittr_ package.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
new_data <- data_peru %>% 
  filter(sex == 1) %>%
  filter(age < 8)
head(new_data)
```

*** 
## Mutate
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Add in an extra column of height squared
mutate_data <- data_peru %>%
  mutate(height_sq = height^2)
head(mutate_data)
```

***
## Select
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Select only id and age columns
select_data <- data_peru %>%
  select(id, age)
head(select_data)
# There are lots of interesting ways you can select columns
# ? select_helpers
```

***
## Arrange
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Arrange in descending order (desc) of height.
sort_data <- data_peru %>%
  arrange(desc(height)) %>%
  arrange(desc(age))
head(sort_data)
```

***
## Summarise
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data_peru %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

***
## Some examples for us to work through together

* Create a table with name, height and mass of Starwars characters who are taller than 150cm.
* How many characters are taller than 150cm?
* Calculate the BMI of starwars characters.  Choose those charactes that are overweight and sort them in descending order of weight.
* Work out the mean mass and number of characters for each species.
Choose only those groups that have more than one character and have an average mass 
greater than 50.
* Plot a graph of the average height for each gender of characters who have been in 3 or more films.

## Some examples for us to work through together

Create a table with name, height and mass of Starwars characters who are taller than 150cm.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:mass) %>%
  filter(height > 150)
```
How many characters are taller than 150cm?

## Some examples for us to work through together
Calculate the BMI of starwars characters.  Choose those charactes that are overweight and sort them in descending order of weight.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(name, bmi = mass / ((height / 100)  ^ 2)) %>%
  select(name:mass, bmi) %>%
  filter(height > 25) %>%
  arrange(mass)
```

Work out the mean mass and number of characters for each species.
Choose only those groups that have more than one character and have an average mass 
greater than 50.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
starwars %>%  
 group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 1,
         mass > 50)
```

***
## Some examples for us to work through together
Plot a graph of the average height for each gender of characters who have been in 3 or more films.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
new_data <- starwars %>%  
 filter(lengths(films) > 3) %>%
 group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) 
```

***
## Some examples for us to work through together
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(new_data) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = gender, y = height))
print(p)
```
