Today's session will cover:

* Tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)
* Dplyr

and is based on Chapter 9 from R for data science.

***

What do you remember from last week?

## What is tidyverse?

A group of packages for data science:

* __ggplot2__ - plotting
* __dplyr__ - data manipulation
* __tidyr__ - creating tidy data
* readr - reading data
* purr - functional programming
* tibble - modern data frame
* stringr - strings
* forcats - factors

***
We are going to focus on dplyr today.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```
***
## Functionality of dplyr
* filter() picks cases based on their values.
* mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
* select() picks variables based on their names.
* arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
* summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.


***
We are going to use the NHANES data set for this example
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
library(NHANES)
data_nhanes <- readRDS("../data/nhanes.RDS")
```


***
## Filtering
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Filter data on sex == 1
filter(data_nhanes, sex == 1)
```

***
## Using pipes
This is from the _magrittr_ package.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data_nhanes %>% 
  filter(sex == 1)
```

*** 
## Mutate
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Add in an extra column of height squared
data_nhanes %>%
  mutate(height_sq = height ^ 2)
```

***
## Select
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Select only id and age columns
 data_nhanes %>%
  select(id, age)

# There are lots of interesting ways you can select columns
# ? select_helpers
```

***
## Arrange
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Arrange in descending order of height.
data_nhanes %>% 
  arrange(desc(height))
```

***
## Summarise
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data_nhanes %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

***
## Some examples for us to work through together

Create a table with name, height and mass of Starwars characters who are taller than 150cm.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:mass, bmi) %>%
  filter(height > 150)
```
How many characters are taller than 150cm?

***
## Some examples for us to work through together

Calculate the BMI of starwars characters.  Choose those charactes that are overweight and sort them in descending order of weight.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(name, bmi = mass / ((height / 100)  ^ 2)) %>%
  select(name:mass, bmi) %>%
  filter(height > 25) %>%
  arrange(mass)
```


***
## Some examples for us to work through together
Work out the mean mass and number of characters for each species.
Choose only those groups that have more than one character and have an average mass 
greater than 50.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
starwars %>%  
 group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 1,
         mass > 50)
```

***
## Some examples for us to work through together
Plot a graph of the average height for each gender of characters who have been in 5 or more films.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
new_data <- starwars %>%  
 filter(homeworld == "Tatooine") %>%
 group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) 

library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(new_data) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = gender, y = height))
print(p)
```
