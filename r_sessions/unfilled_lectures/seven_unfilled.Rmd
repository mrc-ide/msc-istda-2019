Today's session will cover good R programming practices.

* Consistency

* Efficiency

* Sharing code
  
* Kables

What do you remember from last time?

"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread"

Tidyverse style guide

***
## File naming conventions

* File names should be meaningful and end in .R. Avoid using special characters in file names - stick with numbers, letters, -, and _.

* If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. If it seems likely youâ€™ll have more than 10 files, left pad with zero:

***
## Inside file conventions

* Use commented lines of - and = to break up your file into easily readable chunks.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```

* If your script uses add-on packages, load them all at once at the very beginning of the file. 

***
## File naming (tidyverse style guide)

* Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and _. 

* Use underscores (_) (so called snake case) to separate words within a name.

***
## Syntax
* Always put a space after a comma, never before, just like in regular English.

* Do not put spaces inside or outside parentheses for regular function calls.

* Place a space before and after () when used with if, for, or while.

* Place a space after () used for function arguments.

***
## Style guide packages
https://style.tidyverse.org
https://styler.r-lib.org

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
#install.packages("styler")
#install.packages("prettycode")

library("styler")
ugly_code <- "a=function( x){1+1}           "
style_text(ugly_code)
```

***
## Style guide packages
Using Addins / Style selection
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
library("styler")

ugly_function <- function(object) {
object+7
}
```

*** 
## Code efficiency
* Use functions for repeated code
    * makes code shorter
    * helps with reproducibility  - can test separately
    
* Use the apply family instead of for / while loops
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
my_function<-function(x){x*2+5}

```

***
## Code sharing

* Use either project files or `setwd()` so can rasily run the code on different computers.

* Use the same style guide so less likely to make mistakes with file names and load the wrong variables.

* Use comments to explain what code does.

## Questions from last times quiz

***
## Kables

Rmarkdown form of tables - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)

kable(head(mtcars))

kable(head(mtcars)) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, angle = -45)
```

***
## Filtering

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
new_data <- starwars %>%  
  filter(lengths(films) > 3) %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))

#new_data2 <- starwars %>%  
#  group_by(gender) %>% 
#  summarise(n = n(), height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%  
#  filter(lengths(films) > 3)
```
