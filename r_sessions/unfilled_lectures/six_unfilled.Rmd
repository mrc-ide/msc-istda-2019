What do you remember from last week?

## tidyr
According to the tidyr website (https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), the goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

* Every column is variable.
* Every row is an observation.
* Every cell is a single value.

***
## tidyr functions

* __Pivotting__, which converts between long and wide forms. Replaces the older spread() and gather() functions.

* __Rectangling__, which turns deeply nested lists (as from JSON) into tidy tibbles. 

* __Nesting__ converts grouped data to a form where each group becomes a single row containing a nested data frame, and unnesting does the opposite.

* __Splitting__ and __combining__ character columns.

* Dealing with missing values.

***
## Long forms

Particular important in plotting.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
relig_income

# New tidyr
longer_pivot <- relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count")

# Old tidyr # - religion
```

***
## Wide forms

You can also use pivot_wider() to perform simple aggregation.

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
head(us_rent_income)


# Extra description of what has gone on

```

*** 
## Making data rectangular
e.g. reading in data from JSON format
unnest_wider() takes every component and makes a new column.
unnest_longer() takes every component and makes a new row.

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
library(repurrrsive) # This line just gives us the data example we need for this example
users <- tibble(user = gh_users)
head(users)
users$user[[1]]

users_wider<- users %>% unnest_wider(user)
head(users_wider)

# Enables you to select the columns you want and puts everything else into a column called user
users %>% hoist(user,
                followers = "followers", 
                login = "login", 
                url = "html_url"
)
```

***
## Nesting
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Row-wise tibble creation
df <- tribble(
  ~g, ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,  2,
   2,  4,  6,
   2,  5,  7,
   3, 10,  NA
)
```

***
## Making models of nested data frames
This could be useful for some of your analysis

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
# Step one: nest your data
mtcars_nested <- mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  nest()
mtcars_nested

# map
# The map functions transform their input by applying a function to each element 
# and returns a vector the same length as the input.
```

***
## Separating data
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
df <- data.frame(x = c(NA, "a.b", "a.d", "b.c"))
df
df %>% separate(x, c("A", "B"))
```

***
## Extracting data
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}

df <- data.frame(x = c(NA, "a-b", "a-d", "b-c", "d-e"))
df
df %>% extract(x, "A")
# Extracting using regex
# [:alnum:]
# Alphanumeric characters: [:alpha:] and [:digit:].
df %>% extract(x, c("A", "B"), "([[:alnum:]]+)-([[:alnum:]]+)")
```

***
## Uniting
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
df <- expand_grid(x = c("a", NA), y = c("b", NA))
df

df %>% unite("z", x:y, remove = FALSE)
```

***
## Dropping missing values
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA), y = c("a", NA, "b"))
#drop_na
```

***
## Replacing missing values
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
  df <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA), y = c("a", NA, "b"), z = list(1:5, NULL, 10:20))
  #replace_na
```

***
## Joining data frames
https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
names <- data.frame("id" = 1:3,
                    "names" = c("Alice", "George", "Katie"))
ages <- data.frame("id" = 1:3,
                   "ages" = c(15,  47, 29))
```

***
## Types of joins

__Mutating__ joins combine variables from the two data.frames:

* inner_join(): return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from 
x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.

* left_join(): return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will 
have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the 
matches are returned.

***
## Types of joins

* right_join(): return all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y with no match in x will 
have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of 
the matches are returned.

* full_join(): return all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, 
returns NA for the one missing.

***
## Types of joins
__Filtering__ joins keep cases from the left-hand data.frame:

* semi_join(): return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. 
A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching 
row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of x.

* anti_join(): return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns 
from x.

*** 
## Some examples to try

1) Make a plot of the mean BMI and Weight against age decade data for the NHANES data set.
    a) Select only the relevant data from the data set
    b) Calculate the mean BMI and Weight for each age decade (you may need to exclude missing data)
    c) Use gather to make the data format long
    d) Make the plot

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
```

***
2) For each race make a facet wrapped plot of BMI against poverty.  Plot a linear model to see if there
is a positive or negative relationship.
    a) Select the relevant columns
    b) Plot Poverty against BMI
    c) Use geom_smooth to add a linear model
    d) Facet wrap
  
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
```

***
3) Make a linear models of the NHANES data set between nested data frames.  Choose three or 
four variables that you think will predict the weight of individuals the best.  Are your chosen
variables significant?

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
```

***
4) Join and tidy up these data_sets
    a) Load in the two csv files
    b) Investigate which is the best join to use on this data set - why?
    c) Clean up the data
   
  
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
```
