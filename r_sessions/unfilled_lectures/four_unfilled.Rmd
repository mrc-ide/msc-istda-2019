Today's session will cover:

* Loading and saving data
* Dates
* Factors
* Recap of loops

and is based on various chapters of R for data science.

***

What do you remember from last week?

## Loading in data

What types of data may you want to load in?

* csv
* text files
* R objects

***
## Loading in csvs
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
?read.csv

# Read in a csv
data <- read.csv("../data/perulung_ems.csv")

# Getting / setting working directory

```
***
## Project files

***
## Loading in text files
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
df <- read.table("https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.txt", 
                 header = FALSE)

# Headers
# Separation

```
***
## Loading in r objects

* RDS - r object with one variable
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data_rds <- readRDS(file = "../data/test.RDS")
```

* Rdata - r object with multiple variables
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data_rdata <- load(file = "../data/test.Rdata")
```

***
## Saving csvs
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data <- data.frame("a" = 1:10, "b" = runif(10))
write.csv(data, "../data/test.csv")
```

***
## Saving r objects
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data <- data.frame("a" = 1:10, "b" = runif(10))
saveRDS(data, "../data/test.RDS")
```
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data <- data.frame("a" = 1:10, "b" = runif(10))
data_str <- "another variable"
save(data, data_str, file = "../data/test.Rdata")
```

***
## What file type should I save my data as?

* csvs can be opened outside R, so are easier to share
* R objects are quicker and easier to read into R
* Don't lose any formatting / data structure types on loading

***
## Factors - what are they?
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
ages <- c(3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 7, 7, 7)
factor_ages <- factor(ages)

# Check if factos
```

***
## Factors
* Useful for telling R your data is categorical.
* Tidyverse package - forcats (factors chapter - R for data science)

```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
#install.packages("forcats")
library(forcats)
?forcats
```

***
## Factors - ordering them
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
mons <- c("March","April","January","November","January", 
         "September","October","September","November","August", 
         "January","November","November","February","May","August", 
         "July","December","August","August","September","November",
         "February","April")
mons <-  factor(mons)

ordered_months <- c("January","February","March",
                    "April","May","June","July","August","September",
                    "October","November","December")

# Order the factors - check ordered with table

```

***
## Factors - what to do when reading in data
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
df <- read.table("https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/test.txt", 
                 header = FALSE)

# Check stringsAsFactors


```

***
## Dealing with dates
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
data <- read.csv("../data/dates_data.csv")
head(data)

# Converting to date
data$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
# Calculating difference in dates

# Turning into numeric


# Converting dates to numeric: origin = "1970-01-01"

```

***
## Dealing with dates using lubridate
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
#install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)
?lubridate

today()
now()

ymd("2019/10/04")
mdy("07/10/2019")

ymd(c("2019/10/04", "bananas"))
```
Lots more information about dates in Dates and Times chapter in R for data science.

*** 
## Recap of loops

* for loops
* while loops
* if/else statements

When would you use each type of loop?

***
## Avoiding loops

Computationally quicker to use the apply family of functions.
```{r echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
complicated_function <- function(num){
  sqrt(num*5)
}

vec_num <- 1:10

for (i in 1:length(vec_num)){
  print(complicated_function(vec_num[i]))
}

# Use lapply


# Use sapply


```
